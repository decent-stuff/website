    1. Get some DCT tokens (from ICP Swap or other users)<br/>
    2. Run <code>dc np check-in</code> with your identity<br/>
    3. Get rewarded with block rewards<br/><br/>
    <strong>Quick facts:</strong><br/>
    ‚Ä¢ 50 DCT initial block reward<br/>
    ‚Ä¢ Unclaimed rewards are carried over to the next block<br/>
    ‚Ä¢ New block every 10 minutes<br/>
    ‚Ä¢ Reward halves every 210,000 blocks<br/>
